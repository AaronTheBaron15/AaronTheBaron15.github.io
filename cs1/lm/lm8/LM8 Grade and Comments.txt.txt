Awesome commenting
+5 for implimenting both randomized inputs and user inputs

Lines 175 - 177 are good cantidates for global variables. Not necessary, but aceptable.

55/50

Whoa! Wild. It looks like it works, but there might be some better ways to get through this. Nothing that I would mark down for, but just as a heads up, you might have over complicated it.

I like how you are modifying i based on what you find.
