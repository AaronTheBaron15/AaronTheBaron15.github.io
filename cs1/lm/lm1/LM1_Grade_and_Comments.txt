Part 1
20/20
Code: Great
Questions: On question 2: you put:
I also made this code: 

cout << “hi” << endl << “how” << endl << “are” << “you?” << endl;

To output:

hi how are you?

I did this to try fitting multiple messages into one cout command.

cout << “hi” << endl << “how” << endl << “are” << “you?” << endl;
should have output:
hi
how
areyou?

There is not a new line between are and you, and the output would be on different lines


Part 2
30/30
Code: Remember that you can only have one main() function per source folder. This might be due to you copying code back and forth, but there were two part2.cpp folders in your source. I moved the one that looked incomplete to the top level file.
Technically correct, but it would have been nice to see what the values you were manipulating are in the cout. So instead of cout << "myNum + hisNum = " << myNum + hisNum << endl; use cout << myNum << " + " << hisNum << " = " << myNum + hisNum << endl;

I don't really care about what the variables are called, I care about what is going in and coming out.

Questions: Good.

Part 3
50/50 
Code:Great!
Questions: First off, the compiler does not do anything with the input, remember that you have to run the compiler before you execute the code. The code itself is the thing doing that converting (dropping). Also, nice tangent on half a person.

Total: 100/100
