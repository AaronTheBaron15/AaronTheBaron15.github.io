This class was an introduction to C++, and the first step in learning how to program. 

I learned about...

1. Variables such as ints, floats, bools, doubles, chars, strings, and arrays.

2. Conditional operations including !=, ==, <=, >=, AND, and OR.

3. Conditional statements from if, else, else if, switch, and ternary operator.

4. Loops including for, while, do while.

5. Functions, template functions.

6. Classes and their concepts, including polymorphism and class heirarchy.
