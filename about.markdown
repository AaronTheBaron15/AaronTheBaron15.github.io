Hi there! My name is Aaron and this is the website I have made to show some of my coding projects and interests to those who are interested! I'm glad you decided to stop by!

I am currently (as of Fall 2021) a Junior at Whitworth University, attending school for a B.S. in Computer Science as well as minors in both math and psychology. I've always had an affinity for mathematics and computers, so I am taking advantage of that.
