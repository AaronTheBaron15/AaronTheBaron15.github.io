-1 | Great data members--this is a pretty creative implementation of this assignment, but size is implemented as a String? Not sure how you're going to do that.

-1 | shareCheetos(), eatHandful(), and takeHandful() would pretty much do exactly the same thing in terms of deducting cheetos from the bag. They sound like different actions, but in relation to the bag, they aren't.

-1 | Make sure to change the class name next time

-1 | Decrease Battery is a weird way of saying drain the battery. If you were truly simulating a computer, this isn't something the user would be doing, but something that the code would be calling internally. Consider making this a private function instead.

-1 | Style | Think about whether your methods should be public or private as you're writing them, and make sure that your methods are serving an unique purpose.
