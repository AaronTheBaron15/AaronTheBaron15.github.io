Lines 93-101 | -3 | Why are you using a for loop to assign a value within an array? Create a variable that will keep track of how many songs are currently in the array instead. It'll be much more efficient.

Lines 106-115 | -1 | Same issue as above. You could've used a variable to hold the number of tracks instead of recalculating the number of tracks every time.

Lines 128-133 | Fine, but it would've been more friendly to your user to express the amount of time in a format other than seconds, considering that we're dealing with a pretty substantial number of seconds here.

Lines 140-149 | -2 | The prompt for printing all the album info says that it should be the only method with a cout or cin. Most of your getters print information instead of returning it.

Line 198 | You shouldn't be manipulating numbers in your main function. Use your other functions for that.

General | -2 | I mentioned this in my last grade--don't put the method name in the comments. I can get that from the function signature. Good job keeping up persistence in commenting, but your comments should be effective.
